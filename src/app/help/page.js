          q: 'What are Product Types and why do I need them?',
          a: 'Product Types are categories that organize your inventory (e.g., Dairy, Seafood, Oils). They help with filtering, reporting, and organization. You MUST create types first in Items ‚Üí Product Types before you can add products.'

        {
          q: 'Can I create a new product type while adding a product?',

          q: 'What is Base Content and Purchase Pack?',
          a: 'Base Content is the individual unit size (e.g., 1 liter bottle). Purchase Pack is how you buy it (e.g., "1 box of 12 bottles"). This helps calculate stock in both individual units and packages.'

          q: 'What is Min Stock and how do I use it?',

        },
        {
          q: 'How do I perform a Stock Reconciliation?',
          a: '1. Go to Stock ‚Üí Current Stock and click "üìä Stock Reconciliation". 2. Download the CSV template. 3. Physically count your inventory. 4. Fill in either "Pack Stock" OR "Base Stock" columns. 5. Upload the completed CSV with the count date/time. The system will automatically adjust your stock levels.'
