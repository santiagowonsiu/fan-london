# Multi-Organization Implementation Status

## ✅ Models Updated with `organizationId`:
1. Item ✅
2. Type ✅
3. Transaction ✅
4. InternalOrder ✅
5. User ✅ (uses `organizations` array instead)

## ⏳ Models Still Need Update:
- ExternalOrder
- DirectPurchase
- PersonalExpense
- Supplier
- StockReconciliation
- ActivityLog

## Next Steps:

### 1. Run Organization Setup & Migration:
```bash
cd /Users/santiagowon/Desktop/fan-london
node scripts/setupOrganizations.js
```

This will:
- Create 3 organizations (Test 🧪, Notting Hill 🇬🇧, Miraflores 🇵🇪)
- Migrate existing data according to your rules
- Data will work even with models not yet updated (will be added in migration)

### 2. After Migration:
The remaining models will receive `organizationId` via the migration script, even though the schema isn't updated yet. The app will work, but we should update the remaining model schemas for consistency.

### 3. Build Organization Selector UI
- Add flag selector to header
- Store selected org in localStorage/context
- Filter all API calls by selected org

## Data Distribution After Migration:

### Test Organization 🧪:
- All existing products
- All existing types
- All existing movements/transactions
- All existing expenses
- All existing orders

### Notting Hill 🇬🇧:
- Cloned products from Test
- Cloned types from Test
- Clean (no movements, expenses, orders)

### Miraflores 🇵🇪:
- Cloned types from Test
- Clean (no products, movements, expenses, orders)
